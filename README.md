> **Plot Minter** is a NFT minting DApp for the crypto project **[Touch Grass](https://touchfreshgrass.com/)** including smart contracts based on ERC721A and ERC20 standard. Touch Grass ($GRASS) was created to encourage disconnection from technology, and engage with the physical world, specifically by being in nature or getting fresh air. The ERC20 token $GRASS was launched on 9/20/2023. The NFT collection **Plots**, viewable also on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/tgplots) includes 125 pieces of artwork created using Midjourney showing hands touch grass. There are 4 categories - green (100), blue (10), red (10), and purple (5). 1 Million $GRASS tokens are required to mint a PLOT. Plots give holders access to unique membership opportunities (access to whitelists, events, etc.).
